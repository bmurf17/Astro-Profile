I have compiled a set of guidelines and steps to help you navigate the process of migrating to Azure.

## Things to Consider

If you are currently hosting your own VMs and considering a transition to a cloud platform like Azure, there are several reasons why such a move would be beneficial:

1. Potential long-term savings: Moving to Azure can result in cost savings over time.
2. Reduced cost of ownership: By leveraging Azure's infrastructure, you can potentially reduce the overall costs associated with maintaining your own hardware.

When contemplating the shift to the cloud, it's important to determine your specific requirements and objectives. Are you primarily seeking an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) solution? If so, there are suitable options available. On the other hand, if you prefer a Platform as a Service (PaaS) approach, Azure also offers relevant solutions. Consider where you want to position yourself on the IaaS/PaaS scale. Opting for IaaS makes it easier to migrate your VMs to Azure, although you may not fully reap the long-term savings and cost benefits offered by the cloud. Conversely, PaaS solutions require some additional effort to become cloud-ready but offer greater advantages for the work invested.

To ensure a smooth transition, ask yourself the following questions:

1. What is the timeframe for migrating to the cloud?
2. How long will your application need to run in the cloud?
3. How soon do you expect to see returns on your cloud migration investment?
4. What is your total budget allocated for this transition?

With these considerations in mind, you are now equipped with the necessary context to proceed with your cloud migration. Depending on the specific services you intend to adopt in the cloud, you may need to make adjustments to your application. This brings us to the five common migration strategies, known as the "5 Rs of Migration":

1. Rehost (lift and shift): Migrate your existing VMs to Azure without significant modifications.
2. Refactor: Modify your application's code or architecture to optimize it for the cloud environment.
3. Rearchitect: Redesign your application to fully leverage the capabilities of Azure services.
4. Rebuild: Rebuild your application from scratch using Azure-native services.
5. Replace: Identify alternative Azure services or solutions that can replace your existing application functionality.

Consider these options when planning your migration strategy, and choose the approach that best aligns with your specific requirements and goals.

Here is a quick visual to break down some of what we've just covered.

## Migration

Once you have made the decision to migrate to Azure, you can follow these steps:

1. Discover
   - Determine what needs to be transferred over (VMs, databases, etc.).
   - Define the desired performance level for the migrated resources.
2. Assess
   - Evaluate the feasibility of moving each component to the cloud.
   - Determine the appropriate size for each resource (avoid overprovisioning to optimize costs).
   - Identify any dependencies or groups that need to be moved together.
   - Identify the Azure services that align with your requirements.
3. Migrate
   - Develop a migration plan, considering any potential downtime or impact on services during the transition
   - Execute the migration plan, ensuring a smooth and seamless transfer of resources.
4. Optimize
   - Continuously optimize your Azure environment as you proceed with the migration.
   - Ensure that your applications and services continue to function properly during the migration process.

Undertaking a migration may initially appear to be a laborious and time-consuming process. However, Azure provides a dedicated service to simplify this journey.

### Azure Migrate

This is the central hub for migrating to Azure, regardless of your current environment. Azure Migrate provides a range of tools to facilitate a smooth transition to the cloud. While some of these tools may require payment, there are also free built-in tooling options available. These tools will assist you in the discovery, assessment, and migration phases of your migration journey.

The built-in tooling supports migrations from the following sources:

1. On-Premises
   - VMware (Agentless)
   - Hyper-V (Agentless)
   - Bare Metal
2. Other Clouds
   - AWS
   - GCP

I emphasize the "Agentless" feature because it allows you to perform discovery, assessment, and migration without the need to install any additional software on your VMs. If you have concerns about installing software on your VMs, this agentless approach alleviates those worries.

I'm hoping this gives you a nice roadmap if are considering moving to Azure migrate.
