My youtube algorithm has recently been flooding me with Devlogs. And I love them. One of my devlog creators is Challacade. He is building a cool video game and watching his progress is fun to see. I figured doing something similar will get me to dust off my blog and maybe develop a little more in my free time.

## Side Projects

I have a cool idea for a side project... I've said so many times. This time though, I think I'll actually build it lol. The idea this time is building upon my book tracker website and expanding it out to more hobbies and tracking interests. I have built a hobby tracker in notion so many times, but I've never had the control over it that I've wanted. Now I'm deciding to just side step notion and build it myself. I'm still figuring out the full tech-stack but I'm planning on using Next, Primsa, and Vercel. I've built something small with these tools before, but I'm excited to push my skills with them a little bit further. Also, I'm trying to push my design and planning skills a little more by keeping a sudo board for myself. Here is my one design that is so incredible lol.
