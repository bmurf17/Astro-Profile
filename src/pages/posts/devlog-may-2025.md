I'm going to keep this one pretty short, but I'm happy with what I've been able to accomplish during this busy phase of life. Normally, when I do a devlog, I provide updates on new features, bug fixes, and what I plan to work on next. But this time, I want to take a different approach—a brief overview and a focus on roadmapping.

## Book Tracker Project

### Overview/Thoughts

A lot of the goals I had for my main project down the hall are now wrapped up. There's still plenty of polish I could add to the app, but I'm feeling like my prespective has shiffted. This project is in a bit of a tough spot for me right now. Even though I’ve made a lot of progress, and I intend to keep mainting it, my motivation has shifted. Outside of polish and maintenance, I don’t have a strong desire to develop new features at the moment. It's also been hard to motivate myself to tackle caching.

But on to goal

### Goals

For the first time, I think my main goal for this project is no longer technical. Right now, my focus is on introducing the app to some of my friends and family. To do that, there are a few small polish tasks I still need to complete, but they’re all in service of making the app ready to share with others.

- Make Caching not suck
- Mobile view clean up
- Get a few close people to test it
- Error handling (be more durable)
- Alerts (actually know when something breaks)

## Quest

### Overview/Thoughts

This is probably the one I've got the most excitment I have right now. I think that this could be a lot of fun to work on especially right now. This project would just be so different than my job that I think I'd get to tackle new problems and explore in a new way. I think right now the main thing I need to do with this is honestly road mapping. Everytime I've jumped in here I just sort of do small easy things without presepective on actually building a game. So I'm going to use the goals section here as a high level feature planning for myself.

### Goals

I'm not really going to hold myself to the order of these goals or really this being an exhaustive list, but right now I just need a way to take the first few steps. At a high level

- Party Move Around a Map
- Combat Flows
- Interact with room outside of combat
- Draw some stuff
- Export/Import Game State

## D3

I have not touched my D3 book and don't really have much intention of it at the moment.I will probably go through it more on an as needed.

Lastly is this website you are looking at! I'm sort of trying to try some new design ideas here. I don't love the layout or design of this sight. Maybe it's just the fact that it's a little stale since I've had it the same for so long. Whatever it is I'm thinking it's time for a refresh. You'll notice that the screen shot is different than the home screen. For now, I have the new design feature flag off as I consider it not ready. Keep your eyes out as I hope to deploy this with the next blog post!
