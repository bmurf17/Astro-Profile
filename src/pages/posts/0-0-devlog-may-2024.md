## Side Projects
I'm still focused on my hobby tracking/sharing idea that I talked about last month. I feel like I'm making good progress. When I start a side project, there's an initial hurdle that most of my attempts don't get past. Usually, I get the basic layout and some simple CRUD operations working, but then I get stuck progressing further.

To combat this, I've proactively sought inspiration from other websites for additional features. Shout out to [Hardcover](https://hardcover.app/trending/month) for providing some great ideas!

Next month, I plan to create a June branch and show the git diff as a concrete example of what I've accomplished this past month.

Key updates so far:

* Set up the simple layout
* Implemented initial routing
* Set up migrations using Drizzle
* Data is now being stored in NeonDB
* Hopefully, I'll have some cool things to show next month, but don't get too excitedâ€”I'll be moving and traveling to Europe for a good chunk of June.
