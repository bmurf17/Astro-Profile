November has been a good month for me in terms of development. Even though I haven't made a ton of progress on my side projects, I'm excited about the work I have been doing. I'll touch on it down below, but I think I have some cool ideas for both the book site and maybe a side project or two.

## Book Tracker Project

### Updates

I know last month I talked about moving more into support mode for this app, but I think I'll probably have a little more ebb and flow with this one. Like this month I was excited to try wrapping up the basics for the stats page (which was a little harder than I expected). Just with a few more fun ideas I want to try out, this won't be my exclusive side project time. I think I've still got plenty of ideas here from user interactions, a robust character tracking system, or more stats are the things at the top of my list right now.

## Other things

![Pudding Cool](/pudding-cool.PNG "Pudding Cool")

This month, I've been stumbing into a lot of really cool website! The one that really stood out to me is [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/). Their story on the death of the love song was mentioned in a recently in the [Change Log's](https://changelog.com/) newsletter. And I went down a little bit of a rabbit hole checking out all of their stories, listening to podcasts with some of the employees, and checking out their more technical blog content. I've been inspired enough by their content to finally commit to tryng to learn some [D3](https://d3js.org/). D3 is one of those libraies I've heard about some many times, but almost every time I've heard about it the context was normally about how steep the learning curve is. That had always kept me from wanting to dive into it. All it took was seeing some people do some crazy cool stuff with it for me to finally take the leap into it. I don't have much of a clear goal on what I'm going to build with it yet, but I have enough data ideas that once I get more comfortable with D3 I'm going to start planning something cool.
