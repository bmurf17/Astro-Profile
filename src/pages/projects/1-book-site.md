Sort of my go to project whenever I want to try and build something outside of work. As you can see, I love iterating on this idea and just trying to grow what I can do with it. I also feel like this is where you can most clearly see my growth as a developer.

## Newest Iteration

ðŸš§ In Progress _Not Yet Deployed_

I decided it was time to try and build my book tracker out using my own api. So, I'm using for hosting my API [Railway](https://railway.app/). I also am doing a few other things on the front end to test my react skills as well. This iteration I'm no longer using Material UI and I'm instead using Headless UI and Tailwind CSS. I also went away from Create React App and I'm instead using Vite. You can follow my developement on Github.

Update: 2/3/2024 
This project was put on hold after railway did away with their free hosting plan in August of 2023. I've considered migrating over to [Render](https://render.com/) or [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) but for now this project has moved down my personal backlog.

## Iteration 2

Check it out live: [Book Website](https://betterbooktracker.web.app/)

I was not very proud with my first book tracking project. So I went back and did my best to clean it up. I added the ability to have more than one user in the website. I also started using typescript with this project.

## Iteration 1

Check it out live [First Book Site](https://book-site-6b76c.web.app/)

This was my first solo React Project. I had never built a full website on my own. I had done a couple tutorial projects and decided it was time for me to try and build something to use. It isn't too bad, but as you can see from my future projects. My code quality and design improve with time.
