Sort of my go to project whenever I want to try and build something outside of work. As you can see, I love iterating on this idea and just trying to grow what I can do with it. I also feel like this is where you can most clearly see my growth as a developer.

## Iteration 4

My best book tracker for sure. This one does for sure give me a bit of free tier anxiety, but you can track all my progress over in dev logs. But you can check out the code and live site.

## Iteration 3

🚧 In Progress _Not Deployed_

This iteration died when railway did away with their free tier. I was already losing steam on this iteratrion, but then when my free tier for my api and db dropped thier free tier and wipped all my data I ended up no pursuing any migration.

## Iteration 2

Check it out live: [Book Website](https://betterbooktracker.web.app/)

I was not very proud with my first book tracking project. So I went back and did my best to clean it up. I added the ability to have more than one user in the website. I also started using typescript with this project.

## Iteration 1

Check it out live [First Book Site](https://book-site-6b76c.web.app/)

This was my first solo React Project. I had never built a full website on my own. I had done a couple tutorial projects and decided it was time for me to try and build something to use. It isn't too bad, but as you can see from my future projects. My code quality and design improve with time.
