  description: "This is probably my favorite book from this past year! I read it early and it stuck with me all year. The format of two enemies writing each other taunting letters and seeing the relationship morph throughout the book... incredible. Honorable Mention to Piranesi by Susanna Clarke, probably my second favorite book but could be 1 depending on when you ask me."

As the years draws to an end, I think I just want to reflect on what I've been able to build over this past year. Looking back, I had some fun with these side projects, learned a lot, and I have some cool thoughts on how I can move into next year. 
## Book Tracker Project

### Overview/Thoughts

My main flagship project over 2025! It works mostly, I still have a couple of errors related to third party book providers, but it has been a long time since I've had to scramble to fix the app. I think I had a goal to get some users into this app, but I haven't taken the plunge to get people on the app. I still want to polish it up a little bit, but haven't put the time in. Maybe having people use it would let me know where to polish it, but I don't want to have people bounce off of it if I open them up to it and then boom they hate it. So not done with this one as I still have to fix some caching and all that jazz.

### 2026 Goals

These goals have remained pretty static over the year. I think I can keep it pretty small though as I mainly need to just knock out some small stuff with the potential to get this into an app store:

- Make Caching not suck on pages that aren't stats
- Mobile view clean up
- Spin up a mobile app

## Quest

### Overview/Thoughts

If I were a betting man, I'd bet this is where I spend most of my side project time this next year. It is fun and different to try and build a game. Idk if it'll ever be good or fun, but I have some passion for this one and think that will carry me through. This next year I have some ideas that might pull me away from this, but this is new and exciting right now

### 2026 Goals

For 2026 I think I only have one real goal and it is to get this game out. That has a lot of sub-goals underneath this, but I'll cross those bridges when I need to. So hopefully my 2026 recap has this playable.

- Publish and host the game

## Story Time

### Overview/Thoughts

I'm including this one here as I spent some time on it + can see myself potentially spending some on here in the next year. I don't have uch to say as I think my dev time was spent to just actually hook this up to a db and such which isn't all that large. But I could kind of see myself turning this into a personal project manager which sort of scares me... But who knows maybe I'll feel the need for it and get to building.
### Goals

If I end up spending time here, I'm hoping to make it easy to use + serve my needs. It'll look like something and maybe at the end of 2026 I'll say this is going to just sit on my github untouched. We will see though.

## Portfolio

Finally the website you are reading this from. In a previous blog I referred to this as a css canvas, and that is still probably how I see it. I don't spend much time thinking about this blog as it serves me pretty well. But as it has looked like this for a long time, I do have an itch to change stuff up. That itch is just low on my list. Maybe I'll get antsy and touch it up, but when there are so many things to build I don't feel the need to play with a blog. 

Here’s the link to this whole website if it interests you:

## Closing thoughts

This year has been a lot of fun. I've been able to build a lot of cool things on my own + at work. I was able to use some of my skills volunteering at Weekend for Good. I'm excited to see me where 2026 takes me but I'm hoping to continue learning and building!
